# WP Abilities API

## When to use

Use this skill when the task involves:

- registering abilities or ability categories in PHP,
- exposing abilities to clients via REST (`wp-abilities/v1`),
- consuming abilities in JS (notably `@wordpress/abilities`),
- diagnosing “ability doesn’t show up” / “client can’t see ability” / “REST returns empty”.

## Inputs required

- Repo root (run `wp-project-triage` first if you haven’t).
- Target WordPress version(s) and whether this is WP core or a plugin/theme.
- Where the change should live (plugin vs theme vs mu-plugin).

## Procedure

Before deciding what to register, read `references/domain-vs-projection.md` — abilities live at the domain capability layer; MCP / Command Palette / REST exposure is a projection. Registration shape and exposure shape are different decisions, and conflating them forces re-registration every time a consumer's constraints change.

### 1) Confirm availability and version constraints

- If this is WP core work, check `signals.isWpCoreCheckout` and `versions.wordpress.core`.
- If the project targets WP < 6.9, you may need the Abilities API plugin/package rather than relying on core.

### 2) Find existing Abilities usage

Search for these in the repo:

- `wp_register_ability(`
- `wp_register_ability_category(`
- `wp_abilities_api_init`
- `wp_abilities_api_categories_init`
- `wp-abilities/v1`
- `@wordpress/abilities`

If none exist, decide whether you’re introducing Abilities API fresh (new registrations + client consumption) or only consuming.

### 3) Register categories (optional)

If you need a logical grouping, register an ability category early (see `references/php-registration.md`).

### 4) Register abilities (PHP)

For grouping decisions (how many abilities to register, and where to put filters vs. new ability names), read `references/grouping-heuristic.md` first — it keeps you from shipping one atomic ability per REST operation.

To avoid drift between the ability and the existing UI / REST code path, see `references/shared-core-service.md` — abilities, REST handlers, CLI commands, and UI controllers should be thin adapters over a shared service. The reference also covers the metric trap (REST handlers that emit usage telemetry) and the `AGENTS.md` rule for keeping registrations in sync when underlying code paths change.

For shared helper patterns when multiple execute callbacks delegate to existing REST controllers, see `references/plugin-family-patterns.md` (identify the shared-API-client vs zero-arg-controllers shape) and `references/delegate-helper-pattern.md` (one helper shape that works, and when not to use it).

For standardized `WP_Error` codes that let agents reason about retry vs. escalation, see `references/error-code-vocabulary.md`.

Implement the ability in PHP registration with:

- stable `id` (namespaced),
- `label`/`description`,
- `category`,
- `meta`:
  - add `readonly: true` when the ability is informational,
  - set `show_in_rest: true` for abilities you want visible to clients,
  - decide `public` and `mcp.public` deliberately. On WP 7.1+, `meta.public` seeds `show_in_rest`, and MCP Adapter 0.6+ inherits MCP exposure from it — one flag opens two surfaces. Write `mcp.public` explicitly, including `false` to keep a REST-public ability off MCP.

Use the documented init hooks for Abilities API registration so they load at the right time (see `references/php-registration.md`).

For worked examples of read-only, permission-gated abilities (single-item *and* collection modes, field-level access gated on `current_user_can`), study the AI plugin's `core/read-content`, `core/read-users`, and `core/read-settings` abilities (WordPress/ai 1.3.0, `includes/Abilities/Gated/`). They mirror the WordPress core ability classes closely and use the `show_in_abilities` registration flag to decide which post types/settings to expose. As of AI plugin 1.3.0 they only register when the **Custom Abilities** experiment is enabled.

### 5) Confirm REST exposure

- Verify the REST endpoints exist and return expected results (see `references/rest-api.md`).
- If the client still can’t see the ability, confirm `meta.show_in_rest` is enabled and you’re querying the right endpoint.

### 6) Consume from JS (if needed)

- For the WP 7.0+ client-side surface (registering abilities in JS, the `core/abilities` store, `executeAbility`, and how annotations affect the HTTP method used to dispatch server abilities), see `references/client-side.md`.
- Two packages: `@wordpress/abilities` (pure store, registration, execution) and `@wordpress/core-abilities` (auto-loads server-registered abilities into the client store). Register your script module during `init`, then explicitly enqueue both your page-scoped module and `@wordpress/core-abilities` with `wp_enqueue_script_module()` on the screen that needs them.
- For older clients or non-WP 7.0 contexts, prefer `@wordpress/abilities` APIs for client-side access and checks; ensure the build pipeline bundles the dependency.

### 7) Expose via MCP for external AI agents (optional)

If external agents (Claude Desktop, Cursor, ChatGPT) should be able to discover and invoke your abilities, first check the runtime. This base skill supports PHP 7.2.24+, but MCP Adapter 0.6.x requires **WordPress 6.9+ and PHP 7.4+**; on PHP 7.2 or 7.3, upgrade the site runtime or stop before installing the adapter. Read `references/mcp-exposure.md` before giving installation, bootstrap, or server code.

**Install the canonical MCP Adapter plugin — do not bundle it.** 0.6.x deprecated Composer bundling and emits `_deprecated_function()` when the adapter loads as a library rather than the plugin. `Requires Plugins: mcp-adapter` is the intended dependency declaration, but the adapter is not on WordPress.org yet ([#178](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter/issues/178)), so pair it with a `class_exists()` guard and an admin notice.

**Exposure now inherits.** The default server (`mcp-adapter-default-server`) surfaces every ability that `McpAbilityExposure::is_public()` resolves true: an explicit `meta.mcp.public` wins, and an absent one falls back to `meta.public`. WordPress 7.1 added `meta.public` and marks every core ability public, so on 7.1 + adapter 0.6+ the core abilities are MCP-reachable without anyone opting in. Set `meta.mcp.public` explicitly on anything you care about, in both directions. Every execution still runs the ability's `permission_callback`. A custom server can explicitly allow-list selected ability IDs, but it also does not bypass their permission callbacks. The adapter maps `meta.annotations` (`readonly`, `destructive`, `idempotent`) to the corresponding MCP tool annotations.

## Verification

- `wp-project-triage` indicates `signals.usesAbilitiesApi: true` after your change (if applicable).
- REST check (in a WP environment): endpoints under `wp-abilities/v1` return your ability and category when expected.
- If the repo has tests, add/update coverage near:
  - PHP: ability registration and meta exposure
  - JS: ability consumption and UI gating

## Failure modes / debugging

- Ability never appears:
  - registration code not running (wrong hook / file not loaded),
  - missing `meta.show_in_rest` (on WP 7.1+ it also resolves from `meta.public`),
  - incorrect category/ID mismatch.
- Ability appears to an MCP client you never exposed it to: `meta.public` is set and `meta.mcp.public` is not, so adapter 0.6+ inherited it. Set `meta.mcp.public => false`.
- REST shows ability but JS doesn’t:
  - wrong REST base/namespace,
  - JS dependency not bundled,
  - caching (object/page caches) masking changes.
- Execute callback returns unexpected errors or silently ignores input:
  - `input_schema` defaults aren't being applied, pagination key drift between the ability and the backing, or `empty()`-based ID validation — see `references/input-schema-gotchas.md`.

## Escalation

- If you’re uncertain about version support, confirm target WP core versions and whether Abilities API is expected from core or as a plugin.
- For canonical details, consult:
  - `references/rest-api.md`
  - `references/php-registration.md`
  - `references/client-side.md` (WP 7.0+ JavaScript API)
  - `references/mcp-exposure.md` (MCP Adapter integration)
